Step: 1
    I created a folder with name of "Assignment".

Step: 2
    command: "npm init" or "npm init --yes"
    I used above command to install the step by step tools to scaffolds to our projects. A created the file with name of "package.json".
    If we install any libraries that will save name and version of it and saved on dependency section in package.json file.

Step: 3
    command: "npm install express"

Step: 4
    I created a file with name of app.js.

Step: 5
    command: "npm install nodemon".
    Using the above command we installed nodemon because if any changes has been done on files then we need to save file and its automatically 
    run the app("npm run start").

    command: "npm run start" using this command we run file and listenting port. 
    http://localhost:4000/ by using these URL we can view output on Webpage.
